To compile program run in terminal using gcc command.
Then run the executable program (e.g. ./a.out).

*Side note:
From what we understand in the instructions is that the parent waits by default and using the & at the end of the command runs the parent and child concurrently.

Based on Screenshot3.png when implementing the & it changes the formatting of the shell, however since the parent and child are running concurrently this is what is expected of the program.
